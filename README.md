ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Drew! I do web development professionally but my true interests lie in mathematics and computer graphics.

ðŸŒ± I build projects to explore my own curiosity and to learn new skills. I'm currently learning Rust! And maybe WebGL sometime soon.

ðŸ“« Find me on LinkedIn (Drew Zemke) or shoot me an email at drew.zemke@gmail.com :)
